# [php_srrSyncSubtitles](https://github.com/caos30/php_srrSyncSubtitles)

Simple webapp to synchronize a SRT subtitles file. The user copy&paste the content of the original SRT file, and must specify the current timestamp and the new timestamp for a subtitle of the begining of the movie and also for a subtitle of the end of the movie. In this way the app recalculate the timestamps of all the subtitles using a linear transformation.
